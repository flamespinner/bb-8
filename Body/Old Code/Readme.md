This is all old code. Most of it is arduino code.


The controller code is build around a custom made controller pcb. I will add the diagram if I can find it. 


The labview folder contains code I created in Labview using the FIRST Robotics Labview WPILib Libraries. (Pre 2012 control system... RoboRio etc)
